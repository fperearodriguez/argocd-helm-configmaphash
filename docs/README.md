# Automatically Roll Deployments with ArgoCD and Helm
Forked repository from [cm-example](https://github.com/christianh814/cm-example).

In this lab, the sample application has a **configmap**. The main idea is to roll the deployment when the config changes.

## Prerequisites

- OCP up and running.
- OpenShift GitOps Operator (ArgoCD)

## Sample app: Helm Chart
The sample app contains several Kubernetes resources. One of these resources is the **configmap**. Take a look at the content of the configmap:

```bash
helm template .

# Source: sample-app/templates/cm.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: sample-app
  namespace: sample
data:
  test.conf: |
    title = "Example Config"
    enableAwesome = "true"
    version = "v1"
```

We see _version=v1_ in this case.

Let's deploy the application by using ArgoCD:

```bash
oc apply -n openshift-gitops -f app-helm.yaml
```

The app is running with the configuration indicated in the configmap.

Argo application           |  Sample app
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="./assets/images/0-app-argocd.png" width=2000>  |  <img src="./assets/images/1-sample-app.png" width=2000>

## Update configmap
Now it's time to update the configmap. Once the configmap is updated, the application will be rolled out automatically to load the new configmap.

First, edit the values in the configmap. Take a look at the git diff:

Push the code. ArgoCD will refresh and sync:

<img src="./assets/images/3-argocd-cm-changed.png" width=700>

See the **configmap** is _OutOfSync_, and also the deployment. Thus, the deployment will be rolled out.

Once Argocd finishes the Sync operation, the application is running with the new configmap:

Argo application           |  Sample app
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="./assets/images/4-argocd-new-version.png" width=700>  |  <img src="./assets/images/5-sample-app.png" width=700>
